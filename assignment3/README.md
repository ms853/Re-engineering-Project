# Assignment3 Notes
## Assignment 3

## Re-Engineering AssertJ

### Instructions

Please refer to the relevant classes that I implemented for this assignment: ClassDiagramTest.java, ClassMetrics.java, 
-DynamicAnalysis.java and ParseTraceFileToCSV.java, along with the relevant packages.
Note that I had to move these files to the assertj-core project in order to carry out the tasks. 
All the source code can be found in both analysisCode but to execute any of the metricies please make sure the following files I have mentioned, are in the assertj-core source folder (Especially the class diagram).
Also, the I copied across the fileComparison package to the assertj-core folder to run the code duplication metrics.

Lastly, all the relevant csv files can be found in the dataFiles/ directory.
